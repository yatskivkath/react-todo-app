# To Do App

This app was created as a part of the [Frontend Mentor's](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge.

The requirements were:
* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Add new todos to the list
* Mark todos as complete
* Delete todos from the list
* Filter by all/active/complete todos
* Clear all completed todos
* Toggle light and dark mode
* Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
* Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application

To run the project locally, enter the command `npm run start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
